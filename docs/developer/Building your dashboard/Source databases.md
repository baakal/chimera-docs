# Source databases

Now that you have scaffolded a new dashboard, it is time to start filling it out with indicators and all the other things that make it a useful dashboard.

The first thing you need to configure are your source database connection details.

We refer to a data source as a questionnaire. While this might not always correspond to your situation, its origins are based in how CSPro operates. Your dashboard can indeed connect to and work with multiple data sources (databases). 

As you should already be logged in using a 'Manager/Administrator' type account, you can directly head to the 'Management' menu (see screenshot below) in your dashboard and start adding questionnaires.

To create a questionnaire, you need to provide two sets of information. The first one deals with the census/survey exercise and the second one pertains to the database where the respective data is stored.
