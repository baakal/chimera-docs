# Introduction

Dashboard Starter Kit is a beautifully designed Laravel package that provides a good starting point for your next census or survey management dashboard. In addition to the basics such as application's login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, etc, it provides
reactive charts, area based filters, map based indicators and so much more.

It is designed using Tailwind CSS and heavily utilizes Laravel Livewire.

While it brings a lot to the table, developers are expected to implement their desired indicators based on their own database structure.
